### Overview
The reason for this analysis was to find out if the proposed ice cream business by W. Avy would be sustainable year-round. We did this by finding the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. Below are the results.

![December Data](https://github.com/jgarciat1/surfs_up/blob/main/december_temps.png)

- First, we analyzed the month of June. After running a query and using the descirbe() function, we were able to get the results for the month. The average temperature for the month of June was 74.94 degrees. The high for the month was 85 degrees while the lowest recorded temperature was 64 degrees. However, I think 64 degrees might have been recorded at night or on poor weather days, as I find it hard to believe that Hawaii would be 64 degrees in the middle of summer. The average of 74.94 degrees seems more accurate as a day-to-day average. 

- Second, we analyzed the monnth of December. After running a query and using the describe() function, we were able to get the results for the month. The average temperature for the month of December was 71 degrees. The high of the month was 83 degrees while the lowest recorded temperature was 56 degrees, agaain, possibly during the night or bad weather days.

- Third, we can come to a conlusion that a year round ice cream business in Oahu, Hawaii would be a great investment. The month of June shows a warm summer and the month of December shows a climate that is not too cold for an ice cream. 
### Summary
In the end, we conclude with the analysis that the ice cream business would be a great investment. The average tempertures for both June and December were above 70 degrees, which is a favorable temperature for ice cream. The lower temperatures were likely during the night or during bad weather, which leads me to the following propositions to further analyze this business proposal and get a better idea of what to expect. 
- I would recommend a query that would analyze the amount of cloudy and sunny days in the island. Obviously, people would prefer ice cream of sunnier days, so we would want to see the average count of sunny days on the island per month. 
- Second, I would recommend a query to see the number of windy days on the island. It is to my belief that people would prefer an ice cream on sunny and wind-free days rather than overcast and windy days. I believe this query would proove useful for the business forecast and analysis.
